# JAUS - Yet Another Url Shortener (that starts with J)

JAUS is a really tiny URL shortener written in NodeJS + Express + MongoDB. It features:

* URL Shortening (duh)
* Forwarding directly and frame-embedding of forwarded pages
* Forwardings of the form "http://url.url?does this work?"
* Managing existing Forwardings
* User Management
* Limitation of number of links created on a per user-basis
